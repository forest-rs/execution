# Consider adding f32 (type + ops)

We currently have `f64` as the only floating type.

This ticket tracks whether to add `f32` as a first-class `ValueType` + op set.

Potential motivations:
- memory/bandwidth reduction when flowing large float-heavy data (e.g. mesh-ish buffers)
- better match to host APIs that are naturally `f32`

Costs/risks:
- doubles float-ish opcode surface (arith, comparisons, conversions, const encoding)
- increases verifier/spec/test burden (NaN semantics, conversions, edge cases)

Decision criteria (suggested):
- only add after we have a concrete workload where `f64` conversions/costs show up
- otherwise prefer `f64` in the VM and cast at the host boundary

# Public bytecode builder (assembler)

Add a public bytecode builder with labels/fixups to avoid hand-assembling byte offsets. Use it in tests and as the basis for a future compiler backend.


## Notes

**2026-01-31T03:29:53Z**

Implemented public `Asm` builder with labels/fixups (`execution_tape/src/asm.rs`) and migrated VM/verifier tests to use it where possible; fmt/clippy/test pass.

**2026-01-31T03:36:59Z**

Added `Asm::const_f64`, `Asm::const_decimal_value`, and `Asm::finish_checked(+_with)` which wraps a single-function `Program` and runs the verifier. Added tests for checked accept/reject. fmt/clippy/test pass.

**2026-01-31T03:44:34Z**

Added `ProgramBuilder` for multi-function assembly and switched VM tests to use `Asm::finish_checked` for verifier-backed assembly where possible.

# Host ABI + symbol resolution

Host call interface keyed by stable symbol + signature hash; argument/return marshalling; host-reported cost.


## Notes

**2026-01-31T02:46:58Z**

Added Host ABI scaffolding: value model (Value, Obj, Decimal, FuncId) and Host trait keyed by symbol string + SigHash; implemented stable sig_hash (FNV-1a 64 over canonical encoding) with tests. fmt/clippy/test pass.

# Host ABI + symbol resolution

Host call interface keyed by stable symbol + signature hash; argument/return marshalling; host-reported cost.


## Notes

**2026-01-31T02:46:58Z**

Added Host ABI scaffolding: value model (Value, Obj, Decimal, FuncId) and Host trait keyed by symbol string + SigHash; implemented stable sig_hash (FNV-1a 64 over canonical encoding) with tests. fmt/clippy/test pass.

**2026-02-03T08:07:03Z**

Verified implementation present in code: Host ABI + value model in execution_tape/src/host.rs and execution_tape/src/value.rs; symbol resolution via Program::symbol_str in execution_tape/src/program.rs and used by VM host calls in execution_tape/src/vm.rs; argument/return marshalling via ValueRef + VM read/write; host-reported cost returned from Host::call and charged against fuel in VM. Ticket scope appears complete; closing.

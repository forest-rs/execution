# Pack bytecode/spans into arenas (no Vec<Vec<_>> anywhere)

Extend the arena approach beyond functions: consider packing symbol strings, const bytes/str blobs, and any remaining nested Vecs into contiguous arenas with offset/len pairs.


## Notes

**2026-01-31T06:06:13Z**

Implemented arena packing beyond functions: `Program` symbols are now packed into `Program::symbol_data` with `SymbolEntry` `ByteRange`s; `TypeTable` is now packed from `TypeTableDef` into flat arenas (field-name bytes + per-struct name/type ranges) to avoid per-struct `Vec<String>`/`Vec<ValueType>` allocations. Updated encode/decode, VM, verifier, and builders; fmt/clippy/test clean.

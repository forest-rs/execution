# Aggregate heap (tuple/struct/array)

Immutable, acyclic structural aggregates; construction and projection ops; serialization policy (Obj traps).


## Notes

**2026-01-31T02:51:13Z**

Added initial aggregate heap (AggHeap) storing immutable Tuple/Struct/Array nodes out-of-line with AggHandle; supports tuple_get/struct_get/array_len/array_get + debug_node. Tests added; fmt/clippy/test pass.

**2026-01-31T05:07:12Z**

Wired aggregates into bytecode/vm/verifier: tuple_new/get, struct_new/get, array_new/len/get. See vm.rs, bytecode.rs, asm.rs, verifier.rs; spec updated. Still pending: aggregate serialization policy (Obj traps) and any future typed-aggregate refinement.

**2026-01-31T05:56:11Z**

Verifier now tracks aggregate kinds/layouts for VM-constructed aggregates and uses that to type-check projections + bounds.

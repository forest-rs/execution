# PR5: Per-run arenas + bytes/str handles in registers

Stop storing owned String/Vec<u8> in VM registers. Introduce per-run arenas and small handles; copy host returns into arenas; copy final results out.

## Design

- Add `BytesArena` + `StrArena` with per-run lifetime (reset each run).
- Replace bytes/str register storage with `BytesHandle` / `StrHandle` in the internal reg representation.
- `ConstPool` loads and bytes/str ops operate on handles.
- Host returns owned bytes/str: VM interns into arenas immediately.

Branch naming: `et-tagless/pr5-arena-handles`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- VM registers never hold owned `Vec<u8>` / `String`.
- Host boundary still works (returns owned, VM interns).
- No new deps; `alloc`-only.

# execution_tape v1

Deliver a `no_std + alloc` register VM with portable bytecode, verifier, limits, and tracing hooks.

## Notes template (recommended)

When closing out a ticket, prefer adding a final note with the following structure (keep it short, but include the “why”):

**Overview**
- Goal:
- Non-goals:

**Concepts + glossary**
- 3–6 short terms/defs

**Why this shape**
- 2–6 bullets explaining the key trade-offs/constraints

**Usage example (intent)**
- 1–3 bullets showing how an embedder/author would use the feature

**Extension points**
- 1–4 bullets for likely next steps

**Gotchas / risks**
- 1–4 bullets for pitfalls (perf, soundness, determinism, portability, etc.)

Added a recommended Wren-style notes template to encourage recording goals/non-goals and trade-offs when closing tickets.
